<p align="justify">
    A simple cross-platform music player application built with java on top of javafx framework. The application is very simple to use and has a very similar interface to some well known options. In fact a lot of inspiration in the interface has been drawn from the these options. The application allows the user to create persistent playlists and to play them at will. The application contains all the basic functionality to be expected of a music player.

<p align="justify">
    This functionality includes, for example, a few different modes of playing through the playlist (ordered, randomized, repeated), skip a song, jump to a certain timestamp and change the volume. There is also an option to play songs just by opening a file/directory and play the song(s) directly without the need of creating a playlist. The application also contains an extremely simple custom json parser. This helps with exporting and importing playlists in an easy-to-manage format.

Libraries used to make the application:
- ControlsFX
- BootstrapFX
